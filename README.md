This repository hosts the source code for my personal website. A place where I openly share my own learnings as an **AWS Cloud Architect, Platform Engineer, and SRE enthusiast**.

Right now, this repo is just a simple place to hold the web file contents. I decided to make it open source because I’ve always been curious about how other sites work, and I wanted to share mine openly. The plan is to eventually turn it into a fully automated setup with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or AWS CDK still to be decided), ideally with a PR-based workflow for adding new posts in a staging environment.
