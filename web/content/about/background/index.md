## Long story short

{{< lead >}}Learn by doing approach since I was a toddler{{< /lead >}}

I've always loved to tinker. Even as a toddler, I could spend hours playing with cables and exploring gadgets. They've always fascinated me! I remember a funny story from when I was 12: my dad brought home a broken computer, and I immediately wanted to repair it. I opened it up and started examining and touching the components, but unfortunately, I changed the power supply voltage input and caused a small explosion after plugging it in. That moment made me realize how much I wanted to understand what was happening inside those mysterious metal boxes.

After some years in the university, I realized that learning was not enough. I wanted hands-on experience, so I started working on different projects, ranging from doing robotic training for school students to volunteering to help with networking configuration and practicalities on Campus Party Europe in Berlin.

I also love to step out of my comfort zone; for example, back in 2022, I faced one of my biggest fears: doing my first public talk with hundreds of people. After that, I realized I enjoyed that fulfilling and empowered feeling. That was one of those life-changing moments, so I now embrace upcoming challenges.
