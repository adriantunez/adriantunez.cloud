Hello! I'm so happy you've arrived here! Let me briefly explain why I finally decided to create my own blog after years of procrastination.

I always loved to tinker; back in the day, I used to have my own blog and a forum for non-related IT stuff where I really enjoyed writing, learning, sharing, and helping others. This seed has been always there, but during the following years, I focused on my career path. Over the last few years, I learned a lot in my consulting job, and concretely the last year, that sparkle grew again; I built my own home lab, and I started to tinker again with new tools and technologies. So, I've decided to take action and write my own technical and personal blog.

Some people tried to stop me. What's to point of sharing if you're not getting credit? Well, it's a valid concern, but my goal is simple: to contribute openly and share what I've learned, giving something back to open source and communities.

AI is trained on the work of people who do share. Therefore, if we stop contributing, there's no future for learning or innovation. I don't see AI as the enemy, just as a tool to work with, not against.

That said, we should push for AI models to credit sources. Fortunately, we're starting to see progress there. For example, ChatGPT has begun to share its sources.

Some years ago, I started doing casual public talks. Our AWS team approached us to seek a volunteer to do a public speech at the AWS Summit in Madrid. I offered to volunteer. Suddenly, I found myself in front of hundreds of people listening to me. Initially, I was petrified, but I enjoyed it a lot after some minutes. That feeling of being helpful and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone is really fulfilling and satisfying. After that, I did some more talks, even online. That's something I'm eager to retake, too!

Later, I stepped out of my comfort zone again by jumping into the consultancy world, where I could help different companies achieve their goals. I realized how much you can learn from having and assisting different customers while working on various topics. And here I am, ready to take another step out of my comfort zone, writing those first lines into what I hope is a helpful blog where we can share technical and non-technical tips, tricks, and even horror stories from time to time.

Check out my [{{<icon"mug-hot">}} Coffee Shots]({{% relref "/posts/coffee-shots-intro" %}}) idea. A series of entries where I’ll share valuable lightning posts of tips and tricks. The goal is to keep my writing habit alive, even when I don’t have enough time for usual blogposting, while also capturing handy things worth remembering.

So let's see each other around! If you want to know more about me, you can check the [about me]({{% relref "/about" %}}) section. You can also contact me using the [{{<icon"envelope">}} contact page]({{% relref "/contact" %}}) or drop me a message on my [{{<icon"linkedin">}} LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantunez/).
