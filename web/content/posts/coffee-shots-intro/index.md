During the last few years, I attended several conferences. One format caught my attention: <cite>Lightning talks[^1]</cite>. Lightning talks allow you to share a topic swiftly, concisely, and informally. I suddenly found myself heavily focused on listening to many different talks that took around 5-7 minutes each. They were highly insightful, guiding you in the right direction all in the time it takes to have a quick coffee.

Writing a blog post can be really fulfilling, but at the same time, finding enough time to write might be challenging. After thinking, I remembered the lightning talks concept and I decided to bring the same idea to my site. And here I am, presenting what I call {{<icon"mug-hot">}} Coffee Shots, a blog post series where I’ll hopefully share valuable shots of tips and tricks. 

There is also another added benefit: keeping my writing habits alive. I'm sometimes swamped. Therefore, finding the time to write will be challenging, but with this fast blog post approach, I'll easily keep my writing habits on track.

Last but not least, I'm not as good at remembering all details and configuration particularities as I would like, so I hope the {{<icon "mug-hot">}} Coffee Shots blog posts help me to remember the details easily.
